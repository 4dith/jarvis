During the British rule, India comprised provinces, which were directly under the rule of the British government and the princely states which were controlled by the local kings. However, these local kings were subservient to the British.Following the independence of India in 1947, it was a herculean task for the newly formed government to integrate all the princely states into the Indian federation.

In 1973, Mysore State was renamed as Karnataka. The Bombay State was also expanded with the addition of Hyderabad's Marathwada region, Saurashtra and Kutch, and the Nagpur division of Madhya Pradesh. New areas were added to Rajasthan. These were parts of Madhya Pradesh,Bombay State and the Ajmer State. The Madras State witnessed changes as the Malabar district was merged with Kerala. The Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi islands were made a new Union territory. These were renamed as Lakshadweep in 1973.Following the States Reorganization Act of 1956, more states were created. On May 1, 1960, Bombay State was divided into the two states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. On August 11, 1961 Dadra and Nagar Haveli was merged with the Union of India and was established as a Union Territory. On December 1, 1963, Nagaland was created.
