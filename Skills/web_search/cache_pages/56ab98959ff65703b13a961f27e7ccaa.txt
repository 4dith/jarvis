There are 28 states and 8 union territories in India.

The states have their own government while the central government governs the union territories.

The states are namely, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal.

The union territories are Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, NCT of Delhi, and Puducherry.

On 31 October 2019, Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, was passed by the parliament. It led to the bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. And on 26 January 2020, the two union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu were merged to form the new union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Thus, due to these changes in 2019-20, the total number of states in India came to be 28, while the total number of union territories became 8. Before these changes came into existence, there were 29 states and seven union territories in India.

The most populous state in the country is Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 199,812,341. The least populated state is Sikkim, with a population of 610,577. Among union territories, Lakshadweep is the least populated, having a population of only 64,473. Delhi is the most populated union territory, with a population of 16,787,941.

Considering the literacy rate, Kerala is the most literate state, and Bihar is the least literate. Goa and Tamil Nadu are considered the most urbanized states in India.

Indian states can’t be compared with each other as each state is unique in its own way. West Bengal is known for its exquisite display of culture and arts. Its capital Kolkata is also known as the ‘Cultural Capital of India.’ Himachal Pradesh has a lot to offer in terms of snow-capped hills and picturesque landscapes to enjoy the pristine natural beauty. For beaches, Goa and Kerala are the best places to visit in India. To appreciate the historical architecture, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have some of the most magnificent forts and palaces.

Although culturally diverse, all the states are unified, keeping the notion of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ alive.
