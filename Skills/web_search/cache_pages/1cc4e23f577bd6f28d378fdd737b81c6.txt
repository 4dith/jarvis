For most kinds of tasks and problems, classical computers are expected to remain the best solution. But when scientists and engineers encounter certain highly complex problems, quantum computing comes into play. For these types of difficult calculations, even the most powerful classical supercomputers pale in comparison to quantum computing. That’s because even the most powerful classical supercomputers are binary code-based machines reliant on 20th-century technology.

Complex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways. For example, modeling the behavior of individual atoms in a molecule is a complex problem because of all the different interactions between electrons. Identifying new physics in a supercollider is also a complex problem. There are some complex problems that we do not know how to solve with classical computers at any practical scale.

A classical computer might be great at difficult tasks like sorting through a large database of molecules. But it struggles to solve more complex problems, like simulating how those molecules behave.

Today, if scientists want to know how a molecule behaves, they must synthesize it and experiment with it in the real world. If they want to know how a slight tweak would impact its behavior, they usually need to synthesize the new version and run their experiment all over again. This is an expensive, time-consuming process that impedes progress in fields as diverse as medicine and semiconductor design.

A classical supercomputer might try to simulate molecular behavior with brute force by using its many processors to explore every possible way every part of the molecule might behave. But as it moves past the simplest, most straightforward molecules available, the supercomputer stalls. No classical computer is able to handle all the possible permutations of molecular behavior by using any known methods.

Quantum algorithms take a new approach to these sorts of complex problems by creating multidimensional computational spaces in which to run algorithms that behave much like these molecules themselves. This turns out to be a much more efficient way of solving complex problems like chemical simulations.

One way to think about this: Classical computers need to crunch the numbers to figure out how a molecule will behave. A quantum computer doesn’t need to crunch the numbers. It can mimic the molecular system directly.

Quantum algorithms can also process data in ways classical computers can’t, offering new structure and insights.
